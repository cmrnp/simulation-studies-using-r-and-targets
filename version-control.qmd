# Side quest: Version control

Before we get too far into this, let's introduce version control to keep ourselves sane

## Using GitHub to track changes to your code

Make a GitHub account if you don't already have one (this is good life advice anyway)

Make a GitHub repository for your simulation. It can be private to start with, if you want, but Open Source Is Cool

Checking out the repository, committing code, pushing, pulling

Provide handy website references to further detail

## Using renv to track R package versions

Several options available now for ensuring reproducibility of R and R package version. Common choices: renv, rix, ...?

How to set up renv for a project

How to install new packages, update package versions, update renv lock file, restore renv from a fresh checkout

Note that renv tracks R package versions but doesn't manage R versions itself (but it will give a warning if the R version you're using is different from the one used to snapshot)
